Hi, I'm Nora, a B.S. Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison graduating Winter 2024. This spring, I'm continuing to work on research problems and preparing for graduate school in Fall 2025. I'm also seeking internship opportunies for Summer 2025. 

My interests involve machine learning topics: natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. At UW-Madison, I'm currently working as a student research assistant through the School of Educational Psychology, studying LLM bias and limitations in education. I have worked on a few projects under the guidance of [Professor Shamya Karumbaiah](https://shamya.github.io/).
