Hi, I'm Nora, a B.S. Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison graduating Winter 2024. This spring, I'm continuing to work on research problems and preparing for graduate school in Fall 2025. I'm also seeking internship opportunies for Summer 2025. 

At UW-Madison, I'm currently working as a student research assistant through the School of Educational Psychology, studying LLM bias and limitations. Under the guidance of [Professor Shamya Karumbaiah](https://shamya.github.io/), we have developed an tool assisting teachers in identifying limitations in AI-graders. After conducting user-studies with this tool, we are polishing our results for a journal publication in Spring 2025.

## Activities
I am active in WACM - ACM's Women in Computing, currently serving as a biweekly coordinator and mentor in their mentoring program. 

Outside of school, I enjoy playing sports, painting, reading, and listening to music.
